```sql
   /etc/plymouth/
```

```sql
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash loglevel=3 fbcon=map:1 gfxpayload=keep video=efifb bgrt_disable"

## üß™ Test Compatibility

This theme works best on:

- Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Arch, Pop!_OS, Mint  
- GRUB 2.06+ with plymouth installed  
- Systems with EFI framebuffer enabled (disable Secure Boot)

---

## ‚ùå Known Issues

- Windows Boot Logo: If dual booting, some UEFI systems may show the Windows logo due to BGRT fallback. The theme disables BGRT, but some firmware may ignore it.  
- Low-res Scaling: On older BIOS systems, animation may downscale or stutter.
